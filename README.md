# Nipun Sujesh — Portfolio

A personal space (live at [nipun.space](https://nipun.space)) where I experiment with 3D web experiences, AI integrations, and data-driven projects. Built to be a living showcase that stays in sync with my work.

### The Experience
*   **Solar Lab**: An interactive 3D planetary system built with Three.js for navigating through my journey.
*   **AI Chat**: A custom Gemini-powered assistant that can walk you through my projects and technical background.
*   **GitHub Sync**: Fully automated project discovery that updates the portfolio the moment I push code.
*   **Technical Writing**: A collection of blogs and notes covering Machine Learning and AI.

### Tech Stack
React 19, Three.js (Fiber/Drei), Framer Motion, GSAP, Google Gemini API, and Firebase.

### Running it locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Luc0-0/Nipun-portfolio.git
cd Nipun-portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```
*Note: To use the AI chatbot, you'll need to add a `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` to your `.env.local` file.*
